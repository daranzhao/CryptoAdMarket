CS136 Final Project: Using Cryptocurrencies to Facilitate Ad Market on Streaming Platforms

## Summary
In our project, we created a three-sided market mechanism allowing for advertisers, content-creators, and viewers in a hypothetical streaming/creative platform. We introduced CryptoTokens into the market, inspired by the idea linked here: https://finnscave.com/2018/02/07/how-crypto-tokens-will-enable-the-disruption-of-businesses-like-uber-and-airbnb/

We hypothesized that introducing CryptoTokens as a way for viewers to invest in content-creators and advertisers to buy ads would be value-generating. More specifically, we wanted to explore the different strategies of advertisers.

You'll find all of our code in this repo, including the three agents and market mechanism. To begin an auction, simply run
```python auction.py```
To change the population of the market, edit the ```auction.py``` file.
To change the strategies of an agent, edit the corresponding ```agent.py``` file.

Certain stats are printed at the end of each simulation.
